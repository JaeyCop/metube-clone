        ## Important Notes
        - **MeTube development relies on code contributions by the community** - the project is feature-complete for the maintainer's use cases
        - **Consider if this belongs in yt-dlp** - if it's related to video downloading, processing, or site support, it might belong in the [yt-dlp repository](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues) instead
        - **Some features may not be accepted** - in an effort to reduce bloat, some PRs may not be accepted
