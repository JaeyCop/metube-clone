        ## Important Notes
        - **MeTube is only a UI for yt-dlp** - issues with authentication, postprocessing, permissions, or other yt-dlp functionality should be reported to the [yt-dlp repository](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues)
        - Before reporting, please test with yt-dlp directly using: `docker exec -ti metube sh` then `cd /downloads` and run yt-dlp commands
        - If yt-dlp works directly but MeTube doesn't, then it's a MeTube issue
